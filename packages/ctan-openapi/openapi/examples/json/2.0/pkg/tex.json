The TeX engine also uses font metrics generated by\n            <ref refid=\"metafont\">Metafont</ref>, or by any of several other\n            mechanisms that incorporate fonts from other sources into an\n            environment suitable for TeX.\n        </p>\n  <p>\n            TeX has been, and continues, a basis and an inspiration for\n            several other programs, including <ref refid=\"etex\">e-TeX</ref>\n            and <ref refid=\"pdftex\">PDFTeX</ref>.\n        </p>\n  <p>\n            The distribution includes the source of Knuth’s\n            <em>TeX book</em>; this source is there to read, as an\n            example of writing TeX — it should not be processed\n            without Knuth’s direct permission.\n        </p>"
